I started working in libraries at the age of 14, and immediately knew where I belonged.  My undergraduate degree is in English with a focus on Secondary Education. I worked with my professors to tailor those education classes to that of a Library Media Professional, and took on extra projects with local school and public librarian professionals.  After graduation, my family and I moved to Hampton, where I began working at The University of Pittsburghâ€™s Law Library in hopes of funding my education.  After my time there, I created a position at the Northern Tier Library, running all teen programs, while still doing the duties of a clerk.  In those 3 years, I built a large and close knit group of tweens and teens, who not only enjoyed programs at the library, but also at Pine Richland High School.  I also created community service opportunities by offering programs that allowed teens to tutor elementary school patrons.  Most recently I attended graduate school where I focused my library degree on youth services, providing library services to the underserved,  and information literacy.  It is my hope to continue my library career in a setting that allows me to work with tweens and young adults, by turning them into lifelong learners, and valued members of the community.
